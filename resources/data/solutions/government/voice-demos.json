For residential decks, you'll typically need a building permit if the deck is over 18 inches high or attached to your home. I can walk you through the requirements: you'll need property surveys, structural plans, and soil tests. The permit fee is $275, and typical processing time is 7-10 business days. Would you like me to connect you with our building department to schedule a pre-application consultation? They can review your specific situation and ensure you have everything needed.",

For potential flooding, here's what you should do: First, ensure you have an emergency kit with water, non-perishable food, flashlights, and battery-powered radio. Second, identify your evacuation route - for your neighborhood, that's Highway 101 north to the community center. Third, sign up for our emergency alert system by texting ALERTS to 67283. If an evacuation is ordered, you'll receive immediate notification. Do you have any family members with special needs I can help you plan for?",

For a bakery, you'll need several licenses: a general business license ($85), food service permit from health department ($150), and if you're doing retail sales, a sales tax permit (free). You'll also need to pass a health inspection before opening. I can connect you with our Small Business Development Center - they offer free consultations to help entrepreneurs like yourself navigate all requirements and even discuss financing options.

As a senior citizen, you may qualify for several tax benefits. At 67, you're eligible for our senior citizen property tax exemption, which can reduce your assessment by up to $50,000. You'll need proof of age and income documentation showing your household income is below $65,000 annually. The application deadline is April 30th, and if approved, the reduction will appear on next year's tax bill. I can mail you the forms today, or if you prefer, our senior services coordinator can visit your home to help complete the application. Which option sounds better for you?",

This month's agenda includes the downtown revitalization project and next year's budget proposal. Public comment period is at the beginning - just sign up at the front desk when you arrive.
