**Date**: August 31, 2025  
**Device**: Mobile  

### Performance Issues to Fix

#### High Priority Issues
- [ ] **Large Layout Shifts (CLS)** - Optimize layout stability during page load
- [ ] **Slow First Contentful Paint (FCP)** - Reduce time to first content render
- [ ] **Poor Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** - Optimize largest element loading time
- [ ] **High Time to Interactive (TTI)** - Reduce JavaScript blocking time

#### Medium Priority Issues
- [ ] **Unoptimized Images** - Compress and serve images in modern formats (WebP/AVIF)
- [ ] **Unused CSS/JS** - Remove or defer non-critical resources
- [ ] **Large Bundle Sizes** - Code splitting and lazy loading implementation
- [ ] **Font Display Issues** - Optimize font loading strategy

#### Low Priority Issues
- [ ] **Third-party Script Impact** - Minimize external script impact
- [ ] **Server Response Time** - Optimize backend response times
- [ ] **Cache Policy Issues** - Implement better caching strategies

### Technical Recommendations

#### CSS Optimization
- [ ] Inline critical CSS
- [ ] Defer non-critical CSS loading
- [ ] Minify and compress CSS files
- [ ] Remove unused CSS rules

#### JavaScript Optimization
- [ ] Implement code splitting
- [ ] Use dynamic imports for non-critical features
- [ ] Minify and compress JS files
- [ ] Move non-critical JS to bottom of page

#### Image Optimization
- [ ] Convert images to WebP/AVIF format
- [ ] Implement proper image sizing and responsive images

- [ ] Optimize critical rendering path
- [ ] Use service workers for caching
- [ ] Implement progressive enhancement

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. Run detailed PageSpeed analysis to get specific metrics
2. Audit current asset sizes and loading patterns
3. Implement basic image optimization

### Short Term (1-2 Weeks)
1. CSS/JS minification and compression
2. Implement lazy loading for images
3. Optimize font loading strategy

### Medium Term (1 Month)
1. Implement code splitting
2. Optimize bundle sizes
3. Improve caching strategies

### Long Term (Ongoing)
1. Regular performance monitoring
2. Continuous optimization based on user data
3. A/B testing of performance improvements

## Monitoring

### Tools to Use
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- GTmetrix
- WebPageTest
- Google Search Console
- Google Analytics Core Web Vitals

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS
- **Load Times**: FCP, TTI, Speed Index
- **Resource Sizes**: CSS, JS, Images
- **Mobile vs Desktop Performance**

## Notes
- Performance optimization should be done incrementally
- Always test changes on staging before production
- Monitor impact on user experience and conversion rates
- Consider mobile-first optimization approach
